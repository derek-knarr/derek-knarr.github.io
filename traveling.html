	<P>I thoroughly enjoy traveling and seeing new things.  A have traveled to several places, both in the US and outside the country.  One of my most recent trips was a trip to New York with my girlfriend, Mara.  Our journy began by taking a train from Connecticut to Grand Central Station.  Once we arrived to the city, we went to the Empire State Building where we went to the observation deck on the 86th floor to see the amazing view.  After the Empire State Building we walked the streets of New York to Rockafeller Center.  Then from there, we explored Central Park for most of the afernoon.  We stopped at various shops and restraunts along the way and ended the day by going to Time Square.  Overall the trip was awesome, and I would love to visit New York City again.  I plan to continue traveling during my life, and I look forward to seeing and experencing new things.</P>
