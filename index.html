<H3><B>Thanks for coming to my home page!</B></H3>  
<P>I was born and raised in Maine and have lived here my whole life.  I have many hobbies some of which include cars, traveling, fishing, and guitar.  In two years I will graduate with my Bachlors degree in Marketing. I stated my college education by getting my associates degree in Automotive Technoligies from Eastern Maine Community College.  I then took an internship with Downeast Toyota who I worked for, for a year and a half.  During my time working on cars I discovered that I was always interested in the new technoligies and advances being made on new vehicles.  I decided that I wanted to work with the new advancements and market them.  That is how I decided to go back to school into the marketing major.  </P>
