<P>		I was born and raised in Maine.  I recently graduated with my Associates degree in Automitive Technologies from Eastern Maine Community College, and I am currently a junior at the University of Maine pursuing my Bachelors degree in Marketing.  Shortly after I recieved my Associates degree, I took an internship with Downeast Toyota before I was hired full time.  During my time working on cars I discovered that I was always interested in the new technoligies and advances being made on new vehicles.  I decided that I wanted to work with the new advancements and pursue a career marketing them.  That is how I decided to pursue my Bachlors in Marketing.  Although I am very passionate about vehicles, my otger hobbies include traveling, fishing, and playing guitar.  </P>
