<H2>^ Pictures of vehicles I've owned over the years ^</H2> 
 
<P>I have always worked or help work on cars most of my life.  I then decided I wanted to learn more and take that interest to a professional level. That is when Idecided to go to Eastern Maine Community College (EMCC).  While going to EMCC I was offered a technician internship at Downeast Toyota in Brewer.  I took the internship and after the internship was complete I took a full time technician job at Downeast Toyota.  I worked for them for a year and a half.  During which time I got my ASE certifactions in General Maintenance and Light Repairs, Steering and Suspension, Brakes and Electrical.  Even though I enjoyed my job as a technician I found myself drawn to new technologies and advancements of the new vehicles.  I wanted to pursue a job that I could market the new technoloiges within the automotive industry.  I will always work on vehicles in my personal life but I am excited to purse my new career in marketing.  </P>
