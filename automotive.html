 <P>	Since I have worked on cars most of my life, I decided I wanted to learn more and take my passion to a professional level. That is when I decided to pursue a degree in Automotive Technologies at Eastern Maine Community College (EMCC).  While attending EMCC, I was offered a technician internship at Downeast Toyota in Brewer. Upon completing my internship, I was offered a full time technician position at Downeast Toyota. During the one and a half years at Downeast, I recieved my ASE certifactions in General Maintenance and Light Repairs, Steering and Suspension, Brakes, and Electrical.  </P> 
 
  <P>	Even though I enjoyed my job as a technician, I found myself drawn to new technologies and advancements in the newer vehicles.  This is why I have decided to pursue a career marketing the new technoloiges within the automotive industry.  Although I will always work on vehicles, I am excited to pursue my new career in marketing.  </P>
