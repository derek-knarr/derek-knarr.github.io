	<P>I really enjoy traveling and seeing new things. A have been several places, both in the US and outside the country.  One of my most recent trips was a trip to New York with my girlfriend.  We started out by taking a train from Connecticut to Grand Central Station.  Then from there we went to the Empire State Building and took the trip up to the 86th floor to see the amazing view that it had to offer.  After the Empire State Building we walked the streets of New York to Rockafeller Center.  Then from there we explored Central Park for most of the afernoon.  We stopped at various shops and restraunts along the way and ended the day by going to Time Square.  Overall, the trip was awesome and I would love to go back to New York again.  I plan to continue traveling during my life and really look forward to seeing new things and trying new expierences.</P>
